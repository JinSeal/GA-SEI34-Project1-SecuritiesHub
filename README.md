# GA SEI - Project 1 - Securities Hub

Securities Hub was my second (zero indexed) project for the GA SEI course.
This project uses Ruby on Rails to present a faux security trading website.
The sites primary function is to enabl users to make trades and manage investment portfolios.

I wanted to make a site that would leverage my financial experience.

The site is hosted on heroku and accesible at: <https://securities-hub.herokuapp.com/>

- Use `ga1@ga.co` password: `chicken` to trade.
- Use `admin@ga.co` password: `chicken` to access administration.
